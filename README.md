Mini Project 5: Augmentative and Alternative Communication Devices

This mini-project uses associative arrays to implement functionality for a simple symbol-based Augmentative and Alternative Communication Device (AAC).
The original assignment can be found at https://accessibilityeducation.github.io/assignments/AAC/AAC.html and the starter code at https://github.com/catiembaker/AACNestedHW.

Resources used:
  AssociativeArray notes:
    I referenced my notes and the readings on collections and AssociativeArrays throughout the project.
  String documentation:
    I referenced the String documentation for the substring method in my AACMappings constructor.
  Collaboration:
    I attended Micah's impromptu help session on 10/13, where I received tips from Micah and also helped others. 
    I also spent about two hours working with Sam Bigham on 10/14.
  External resources:
    I modeled the code for reading from a file in the AACMappings constructor from this webpage: 
    https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/java-read-file-line-by-line
  SamR:
    I followed Sam's method for implementing getKeys and creating generic arrays.
